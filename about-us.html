<h2>Our history</h2>
<p>David and Ann English dreamed up Netherhall Archers in 2001. It is called <i>Netherhall</i> because that is what the area was called in days gone by. The name choice had nothing to do with the name of the school where we shoot!</p>

<p>David wore an arrowhead on a chain around his neck and the club badge was designed to emulate that arrow head. They personally bought the initial equipment needed to get the club up and running. The club had eight founder members and initially they shot on a Saturday morning once a week in the outdoor season.</p>

<p>The club had a brilliant first year, with few days when we couldn't shoot on a Saturday, on the small field beside the Sports Hall at the Netherhall school.</p>

<p>The club built up members and managed to hire the indoor facility once a week too.  We were given space in the large container for a while and, after we had been running for a couple of years, we applied for a National Lottery Grant that enabled us to buy the small container and a lot of training bows for new archers.</p>

<p>The University Archers used to come and shoot with us indoors and helped with their target fees to build up the Club.</p>
