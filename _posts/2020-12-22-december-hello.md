# Happy Christmas from Netherhall Archers!

Just a quick email to say a BIG THANK YOU to all our members who have stuck with us this year. We have kept going and have shot when we have been able to. I know the archers who joined us appreciated the chance to shoot and I'm looking forward to getting us all back together shooting in 2021.

And a big thank you to all the committee - honestly they have gone above and beyond in lots of ways.

At this point I am not sure what will happen in the New Year - I guess I could make some money if I knew! We will shoot if we can but given the rapidly changing situation I will put out the booking for shooting in January much closer to the date. Although we love shooting, it is not 'essential' travel so if you live in an area where  travel is discouraged we would ask you not to book.

I cannot express how much I wish you all a happy and healthy 2021!

Yours,
Emma, Chair
