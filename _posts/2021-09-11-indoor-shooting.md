Dear Members,

We have met as a committee and discussed the best way of going back to archery indoors.

For those new to the club (or the forgetful!) we move inside to Netherhall Sports Centre into their large sports hall from October until March. We shoot at 18m / 20 yards with 10 bosses up (one usually being reserved for compound archers).

Archery GB and government guidance have left the decisions up to us as a club and we have decided to run sessions as follows:

Sessions will be Saturday morning 10-1 and Monday evenings 6-8pm starting on 2nd October.

We will have the full range set up (10 bosses).

Archers are expected to help with set up and take down of the range. Gloves are required as we use straw bosses inside which can hurt hands.

We will allow archers to share bosses, score and collect together.

If numbers deem it necessary we will run two details of archers.

We will have both sets of doors open to allow airflow and encourage the use of hand sanitiser. You would be very welcome to wear a mask (except whilst shooting).

We will return to our membership finance model - you will be asked to pay for the 6 months (£98.50 for standard adult, £64 for juniors, plus concessions) alongside your AGB membership (£52 adult, £15 junior and under-25, £12 for archers with disabilities, slightly more if you were not an AGB member in 20/21) - both managed through the club.  You will be invoiced individually via ManageMyClub, for payment by bank transfer. This will mean no PAYG or booking will be needed.

We will only use Eventbrite for club competitions and end of month shoots to help us organise targets etc. (these will be free).

As always I am happy to chat to members,

Emma
